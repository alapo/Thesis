Want to find which set of fgr parameters will cause bison to produce a time series closely as possible to the experiment as possible. To this end, need viable range of parameter values and parameters to tweak. Giovaani and Laura have done extensive research to obtain such quantities. The fgr parameters that will be tweaked are... and their uncertaineis are... Show where they appear in FGR equations. 
Kriging based on producing surrogates for scalar quantities. We want a surrogate for time series. Effectively need to train surrogate at each time step. PCA to the rescue. We want to input some FGR parameters and get a time series out of it. Make sure same times are used, 150 points are taken for bison fgr and experimental data. Splines used. Tests for more and less were conducted... 150 points adeuqate to not differ from original data.  
Doesn't make sense to use collocation here. 
Only 3 kriging surrogates
error metric is MSE. others were tried.
cross-validation of surrogates
smoothing results?
