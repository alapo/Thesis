In this section Bison is used to model the Ris\o~ AN3 power ramp fission gas release time series. More specifically, given the wide uncertainty in the input fission gas release parameters the problem of identifying parameter values resulting in Bison predictions most similar to experimental data is tackled. Since a single Bison simulation of the Ris\o~ AN3 power ramp is a computationally expensive, the surrogate construction techniques described in chapter \ref{chap:rom} will be employed. Recall that calibration exercises require thousands of instances of computer code simulations. Consequently, without the use of surrogates parameter calibration would not be feasible in this problem. Of the two surrogate construction techniques described, namely Kriging and the collocation approach, Kriging is more applicable for the problem in hand. Both surrogate techniques are designed for modeling surrogates of scalar quantities. However, in this problem a surrogate for an entire time series is desired. Of course, a surrogate can be constructed at each time-step but this would be extremely expensive considering there are $\mathcal{O}(100)$ time-steps. Kriging is used here mainly because it can most easily be extended when only a set and limited number of Bison simulations can be afforded.
