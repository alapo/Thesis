\section{General Observations}
\label{sec:general_observations}

Before moving on to a large-scale engineering system a few general observations regarding the application of collocation-based reduced order models to the uncertainty quantification of the  reactor systems described are in order. Primarily, the demonstration problems indicate that use of only 1D components in the anchored-\ac{ANOVA} expansion provides a very good approximation to the true system under investigation. From a computational point of view, 1D components are cheap to build and their quantity is equal to the number of random variables modeled. Higher order components generally require higher levels of interpolation and so their construction should be minimized if possible. As mentioned in \cite{AHSGC_HighDimensions}, the interaction effects between random variables for most realistic physical systems have a negligible effect on outputs of interest. 

Nevertheless, if multivariate components are needed algorithm \ref{code:rom_algorithm} is able to identify the combination of components most likely to affect the output, which offers significant computational savings. For example, if all components of two random variables were to be included in the anchored-\ac{ANOVA} expansion then 4950 two-dimensional sparse grid interpolants would need to be built. However, if only 5 of the 100 variables are deemed "important" by algorithm \ref{code:rom_algorithm} then only 10 two-dimensional sparse grid interpolants will be built. Not to mention, identification of variables that most affect the variability in some computer code output of interest offers insight into the physical system under consideration. It should be reemphasized that components of the anchored-\ac{ANOVA} used to build reduced order models do not represent the order of effects on the output. Even the 1D component functions can model nonlinear behavior as discussed in section \ref{subsec:anchored_anova}. Rather, the multivariate components describe the affect of input variables upon some output when acting together.    

For the demonstration problems investigated in this chapter, the Clenshaw-Curtis collocation abscissas performed significantly better than Gauss-Patterson. The Clenshaw-Curtis knots offered effectively the same convergence rates as Gauss-Patterson with far fewer function evaluations. Not to mention, Clenshaw-Curtis knots are much easier to generate.
