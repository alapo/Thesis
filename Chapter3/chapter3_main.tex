The methodology described in Chapter \ref{chap:rom} will initially be applied to three relatively simple problems in reactor physics, each building on each other in complexity. The purpose of the simple problems is to develop some untuition about the workings of the described reduced order model algorithm. Ultimately, the methods will be applied to solve a state of the art problem in reactor uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis.
