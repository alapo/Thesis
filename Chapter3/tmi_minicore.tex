\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{subsec:tmi_minicore_ps}

The previous two problems dealt with relatively simple functions that don't require industrial engineering codes to solve. However, the main intention of this thesis is to construct reduced order models for computer codes that aim to model large engineering systems. Interaction with such computer codes consist of input and output files; the governing equations and their solvers are rarely seen. The primary purpose of this demonstration problem is to show that the same algorithms applied to analyze the previous problems are also functional when applied to engineering computer codes.

In this demonstration problem the reactor core simulator code \ac{PARCS} \cite{PARCS} is applied to the \ac{TMI} minicore described in the first phase of the \ac{UAM} Benchmark \cite{UAM_Benchmark}.
