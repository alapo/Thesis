% Reduced-Order Models

Computer codes that model physical phenomena typically accept an input file whose purpose is to describe specific conditions in the universe being modeled by the code. The code is executed and the affects of the conditions on some dependent quantities are output. From this perspective computer codes can be viewed and treated in much the same way functions mathematicians deal with are treated. Like matrices, functions with certain properties can undergo various decompositions that offer insight into their structure. The purpose of \ref{sec:func_decomp} is to describe a technique for decomposing functions into orthogonal components, with the ultimate intention of applying the technique to computer codes. It is hoped that the decomposition of the computer code in terms of its inputs reveals which inputs play the most active roles in the underlying physics. Keeping only the most active dimensions in the decomposition, a reduced order model is effectively built. However, the function decomposition technique described in \ref{sec:func_decomp} describes only half the story. To create a reduced order model of a computer code that can be efficiently evaluated at any state point in the original parameter space an efficient, multidimensional, interpolation scheme is needed. Such a scheme is discussed in \ref{sec:smolyak_sg}. The coupling between interpolation and function decomposition that creates a useable reduced order model is described in \ref{sec:decomp_and_interp}.
